# www.olbe.store

✔ What’s in store for you! Well, you may think this is just another website. I don’t really feel like making an account over here. These guys would perhaps spam my inbox! Lol, no we wont! To know what’s in store for you? Just read on!

✔ Students You have passed your semester ! and you need books again.You rush to local old books dealer who will charge you 70% for old Books and then return the same book at 25% price even if you want it for two days.

✔ Switch to olbe.in! Search the book in your neighbourhood collegemate, buy/sell/exchange it at cheaper price and in future you can even sell it here at a better prices!

✔ Reading Enthusiasts I know most of you guys will kill me if I tell you to sell your books. No, don’t sell them! Umm…But you can surely think of exchanging them for next semester! Or perhaps look in the neighbourhood collegemate, someone might be selling his collection off and you too could strike a deal!
